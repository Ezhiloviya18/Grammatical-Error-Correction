## Introduction

The Grammatical Error Correction using T5 Model and HappyTransformer project focuses on utilizing the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model to correct grammatical errors in text. HappyTransformer, a Python library for easy implementation of Transformer models, is used to fine-tune the T5 model on the Lang-8 dataset, which contains sentences with grammatical errors and their corrected versions.

## Features

- **Model Training:** Train a T5 model using the HappyTransformer library.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tune the T5 model on the Lang-8 dataset for grammatical error correction.
- **Inference:** Correct grammatical errors in input sentences using the trained model.

## Usage

1. Preprocess the Lang-8 dataset or prepare your custom dataset (if applicable).
2. Train and fine-tune the T5 model using HappyTransformer.
3. Use the trained model for inference to correct grammatical errors in input sentences.

Detailed instructions for each step can be found in the [Usage Guide](usage_guide.md).

## Technologies Used

- HappyTransformer: A Python library for Transformer models
- T5 Model: A versatile Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer model
- PyTorch: Deep learning framework
- Python: Programming language

## Dataset

The Lang-8 dataset is a widely used dataset for grammatical error correction. It contains sentences written by non-native English speakers along with their corrected versions. You can access the Lang-8 dataset at [Lang-8 Dataset](https://lang-8.com/).
